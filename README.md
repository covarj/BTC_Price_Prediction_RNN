# BTC Price Prediction using RNN

Jupyter Notebook for computing BTC price predictions using a Recurrent Neural Network.

This notebook was created with the intent of illustrating how RNN's can be used to predict the value of an asset based on historical data. No signicant efforts were made to fine-tune the hyperparameters involved in the algorithm. There is still significant room for improvement.
